Generate JUnit 5 + Mockito test classes for all Java classes under src/main/java, ensuring ≥80% line and branch coverage (JaCoCo).
Follow these rules:

Mirror package structure; name tests <ClassName>Test.

Cover happy path, edge cases, exceptions, and null inputs.

Use mocks for external dependencies (DB, HTTP, etc.).

Batch the generation (≈25–40 classes per run) to avoid stalls.

After each batch:

Run tests (mvn test or ./gradlew test)

Fix failing tests until all pass

Re-run coverage report (jacoco:report or jacocoTestReport) and raise coverage to ≥80%

Repeat batches until all classes are tested, all tests pass, and global coverage ≥80%.
